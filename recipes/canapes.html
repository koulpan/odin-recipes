            <li>Drizzle the cones with the olive oil, sprinkle them with some salt and pepper, 
                put the pan in the oven, and bake the bread cones for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the oven and discard the crumpled parchment paper balls.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the onion, parsley, and tomato on a chopping board.</li>
