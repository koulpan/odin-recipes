        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>For the sweet potatoes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350° F) set to fan.</li>
            <li>Line a baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Use a fork to prick the sweet potatoes on all sides and wrap each one with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Put the sweet potatoes in the pan.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and bake the sweet potatoes for 1 to 11⁄2 hours (depending on their size).</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the oven, take out the sweet potatoes, and remove the aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Cut the sweet potatoes horizontally in half, while they are still hot, remove their flesh with a spoon and put it in a bowl.</li>
            <li>For the recipe, you will need 400 g of the flesh. 
                Store the leftover flesh in the refrigerator for future use (for example, to accompany a dish or to puree it).</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For the pancakes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the 400 g sweet potato flesh in a second bowl and crush it with a fork.</li>
            <li>Add salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and mix well with the fork.</li>
            <li>Add the 2 egg yolks, 2 eggs, and the finely chopped fresh herbs, and mix.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and mix until it is incorporated into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg whites into a bowl until they are fluffy and you have a nice meringue.</li>
            <li>Add the meringue into the mixture with the eggs and fold gently with a silicone spatula.</li>
            <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat and add 1 teaspoon of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Use a tablespoon to take a little of the batter and add it to the pan. 
                Add 4 tablespoons in total and make sure to leave some space between the pancakes. </li>
            <li>Cook the pancakes for 2 minutes on one side, 
                flip them over, and cook them for another 2 minutes -or as long as needed- until they are cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the pancakes from the pan and put them on a plate with some paper towels.</li>
            <li>Wipe the pan clean with paper towels and follow the same process for the whole pancake batter. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To assemble</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the pancakes on a plate, add the cherry tomatoes on top along with the turkey, 
                rocket, and feta cheese crumbled with your hands, 
                and sprinkle with some salt, pepper, thyme, and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Serve</li>
        </ol>
